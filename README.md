##Anagram Aid
Do you enjoy the mental exercise of solving anagrams but not the drudgery which is sometimes involved? Here is an aid with different behavior for short and long anagrams. With a long anagram, random re-arrangements of the letters are listed as clues. Short anagrams produce a list of permutations. One may remove letters and study the remainder. Removed letters can be returned.

Looking at the clues can bypass the mental block preventing you from seeing the solution. Install the package, then 'World > New morph... > From Alphabetical List > AnagramMorph' or:
